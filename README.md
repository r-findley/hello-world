The beginnings of my development journey
Hi all! This is Ryan. I'm excited to begin this journey. I've spent the last 13+ years working in the insurance industry and am now looking at a career change. I've begun learning web development and am ultimately working towards full stack development. I'm a fast learner and am looking forward to working with others to help my knowledge grow.
